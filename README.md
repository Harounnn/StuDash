## Dataset
[Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theworldbank/world-bank-intl-education?select=country_summary)

I manually gathered data by searching a lot from google datasets to kaggle to so many different websites and I was thinking even to web-scraping . But , I found this dataset which is originally a BigQuery dataset but I made a decision to explore it through multiple csv files.

## About the notebook
Github don't render embedded HTML in notebooks so to see the visualizations that are present in the EDA notebook so I displayed it as PNG images but I still suggest downloading it locally and run it yourself if you are intrested in interactive plots , because at the moment the application is not yet done . When it is done , the visualizations will be available of course in the web-based dashboard.
