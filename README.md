## About the notebook
Github don't render embedded HTML in notebooks so to see the visualizations that are present in the EDA notebook so I displayed it as PNG images but I still suggest downloading it locally and run it yourself if you are intrested in interactive plots , because at the moment the application is not yet done . When it is done , the visualizations will be available of course in the web-based dashboard.
